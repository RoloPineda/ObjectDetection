This is a face detection model

Libraries used:
    - Labelme
    - Albumentations
    - Tensorflow

Our machine learning models are be:
    - Classification model
    - Regression model

We will also be using a binary classification loss function, for our face classification. Furthermore, we will use localization functions.
We will use the top layers for the VGG model.
